# Volunteer Bot 

VolunteerBot is built on the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://docs.botframework.com) to take advantage of the support it provides for connecting it to the wide range of communcation clients. Specifically, it uses the [Bot Builder for .NET](http://docs.botframework.com/sdkreference/csharp), although [support for Node.js](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/node/builder/overview) also exists, and this implementation should be portable to Node.js.

This project depends on [NuGet](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=320961), which will restore the required dependency packages on build.
